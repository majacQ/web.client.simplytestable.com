Hello!

This is to confirm that your {{plan_name}} plan subscription has been
cancelled and you're back on our free plan.

Could you please take a couple of mintes to reply and let me know why you
chose to cancel your premium subscription?

The service exists for you and others like you. If there's anything you weren't
happy with that made you choose to cancel your subscription I'd love to know.
As founder of Simply Testable I can make changes happen.
