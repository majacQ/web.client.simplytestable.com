            <p>
                Some common reasons for this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    you have reached your card's limit
                </li>
                <li>
                    your card has been blocked
                </li>
                <li>
                    your card provider's fraud checks are a little flaky
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you can't immediately figure this one out, give your
                card provider a call and ask them why charges for Simply Testable
                are being declined.

            <p>
                You need to add a credit or debit card so that we can take payment for
                your premium subscription.
            </p>

                An error occurred while processing payment for your premium subscription.
            </p>
            <p>
                This can happen from time to time if your card provider is having issues.
                Sometimes we ask them to charge your card and they just ignore us.
